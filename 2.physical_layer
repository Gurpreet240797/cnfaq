
1. Which transmission media has the highest transmission speed in a network? 
  optical fiber

2. Which transmission media has the highest transmission speed in a network?
   optical fiber.
   
3. Bits can be send over guided and unguided media as analog signal by?
   digital modulation
   
4. physical layer provides?
   mechanical specifications of electrical connectors and cables, electrical specification of transmission line signal level, specification for IR over optical fiber

4 .What is the OSI model?
OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection and
was created by ISO, the International Standards Organization.
The OSI "reference model" divides particular networked processes into seven different layers:
Application (Layer 7) 
Presentation (Layer 6) 
Session (Layer 5) 
Transport (Layer 4) 
Network (Layer 3) 
Data Link (Layer 2)
and Physical (Layer 1)

5.What is the Network Time Protocol

The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is a protocol for synchronizing the clocks of computer
systems over packet switched, variable latency data
networks. NTP uses UDP as its transport layer. It is designed particularly to
resist the effects of variable latency.

6.What is virtual network?

An internet architecture in which routers connect multiple physical networks.

7.Is internet a virtual network?
yes An internet is a single virtual network
that interconnects all hosts and through which communication is possible ;its
under lying architecture is both hidden and irrelevant.

8.What are the functions of data link layer in OSI model?

Framing: it divides the stream of bits received from the net
work layer, physical addressing ,flow control ,error control
and access contr

9 .Bits can be send over guided and unguided media as analog signal by which modulation?
  digital modulation

10 .The physical layer translates logical communication requests from the ______ into hardware specific operations. 
   data link layer

11 .A single channel is shared by multiple signals by:    
    multiplexing
    
12. Wireless transmission can be done via:     
   radio waves, microwaves, infrared  

13) What does Physical Layer mean?
The physical layer is the first layer of the Open System Interconnection Model (OSI Model).The physical Layer deals with bit level
      transmission.
      
14) List the services provided by the physical layer?
    * Bit synchronization for synchronous serial communications.
    * Bit interleaving to improve error correction.
    * Auto-negotiation
    * Transmission mode control.
